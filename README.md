# Liri-Node-App
This is a terminal based app where the user can enter a few different inputs and get some cool information back!

The user can enter:
* spotify-this-song "user song choice here",
* movie-this "user movie choice here",
* my-tweets - which will return the last 20 tweets made by Gary V.
* do-what-it-says - will grab the text from a random text file and run the command inside.
